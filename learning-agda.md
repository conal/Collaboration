## Learning Agda

Some resources:

*   "Propositions as Types" by Philip Wadler.
    This [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU) and [paper](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf) present the deep connection (equivalence/isomorphism) between logic and dependently typed programming, often called "the [Curryâ€“Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence)", as discovered and developed during the 20th century.
    I consider the fundamental equivalence of computation and constructive logic to be the most powerful and beautiful insight in computer science.
    Agda is the prettiest and smoothest language I know of that embodies this insight.
*   Part one of [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/).
    (Parts two and three are rooted in operational rather denotational thinking.)
*   [The Agda Wiki](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) has many papers and tutorials.
*   The Agda Zulip community is very helpful!
    See the [Agda community page](https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/Main/Community).

You'll probably find that correct programming is more difficult than standard programming, but it's usually harder to do *anything* correctly than incorrectly.

Some advice: remember to have fun!
Enjoy the learning experience in itself rather than trying to get it out of the way to get to something else.
If it doesn't feel like play, try to shift something about how you are relating to the journey.
